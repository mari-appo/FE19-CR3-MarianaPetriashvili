            <p>In our kitchen we cook with attention to detail. Our chef Alexander Berger attaches particular importance to regional and seasonal products from farmers and suppliers from Vienna and the surrounding area. This results in creative, innovative
                dishes full of authenticity and down-to-earthness, which bring the individual taste components to the fore. <br> The vaulted interior is finely covered; however, we enjoyed the guest garden in the courtyard on a summer evening. Food and
                menu of the finest - well coordinated (also with wine accompaniment), flexible with preferences and allergies. We were particularly impressed by the service team, present, coordinated, flexible, attentive and cordial. A hospitality that
                has evening excellent!</p>
